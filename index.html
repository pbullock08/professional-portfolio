            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>As a black woman of Afro-Caribbean descent, I am quite adaptable and am able to contribute a unique perspective to any conversation. Over the last eight years I have worked at PowerCorpsPHL, a workforce development program for young adults disconnected from work or school. During this time I have worked as a career advisor and more recently the Manager for Training and Curriculum. I pride myself on organization, attention to detail, and creative problem solving. 

            I recently joined the University of Pennsylvania's Coding Bootcamp where I am learning the ins and outs of web development. My goal is to be able to contribute to the workforce developmnt field with this skillset.
